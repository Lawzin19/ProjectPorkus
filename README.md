# Porkus Project üêñ

**Porkus Project** is a custom Minecraft plugin developed on the Bukkit platform. The main goal of this project is to create a **personal piglin** companion, named Porku, who follows the player and interacts with the environment. Porku will move naturally when the player walks, staying within a limited area around its summon point.
